title: Blogging about Appium

In an effort to help the rapidly growing Appium community -- it made sense to get up a blog that folks can contribute to using the pull request OSS workflow. Hosting the whole blog out of GH makes this really easy, and great to interact with as a community.

If you have topics you think should be here, please <a href="https://github.com/appium/blog/tree/gh-pages">fork the repo</a>, write your blog entry and submit a merge!

If you have any issues, please talk to use on the #appium irc channel so we can help you get setup.

Cheers,
